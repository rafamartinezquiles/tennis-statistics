# Design and Development of a Modular Satellite-Imagery Time-Lapse Generator Using Planetary Computer and Streamlit
This project implements a fully modular and extensible system for retrieving, processing, and visualizing multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Built with Streamlit, Folium, the Microsoft Planetary Computer STAC API, and modern geospatial libraries such as ODC-STAC, Xarray, and NumPy, the application allows users to interactively define a geographic region, select temporal ranges, control cloud-cover filtering, and choose spectral combinations—including custom band composites and NDVI. The pipeline loads and harmonizes remote-sensing data, generates RGB or NDVI frames, applies optional vegetation-index analytics, and exports a high-quality MP4 time-lapse video.
