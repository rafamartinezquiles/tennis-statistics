# Design and Development of a Modular Satellite-Imagery Time-Lapse Generator Using Planetary Computer and Streamlit
This project implements a fully modular and extensible system for retrieving, processing, and visualizing multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Built with Streamlit, Folium, the Microsoft Planetary Computer STAC API, and modern geospatial libraries such as ODC-STAC, Xarray, and NumPy, the application allows users to interactively define a geographic region, select temporal ranges, control cloud-cover filtering, and choose spectral combinations—including custom band composites and NDVI. The pipeline loads and harmonizes remote-sensing data, generates RGB or NDVI frames, applies optional vegetation-index analytics, and exports a high-quality MP4 time-lapse video.

## Overview and Background
Generating meaningful visualizations from satellite data requires a complete pipeline for acquiring, filtering, processing, and compositing multispectral imagery into user-friendly products. In this project, geospatial data from the Sentinel-2 L2A collection is retrieved directly from the Microsoft Planetary Computer using its STAC API. The user defines an area of interest interactively by drawing a polygon on a Folium-powered map, and selects a date range, cloud-tolerance settings, and a spectral visualization mode. These parameters are then used to query the STAC catalog and load only the relevant scenes into an optimized Xarray dataset via ODC-STAC.

Each frame of the time-lapse is produced by combining the selected spectral bands, such as natural color (B04, B03, B02), color-infrared (B08, B04, B03), or vegetation-focused composites, and applying robust normalization to produce clear RGB output. For analytical modes like NDVI, the system computes vegetation index values and maps them to a perceptual colormap, producing scientifically meaningful visual transitions over time. Optional analytics compute NDVI statistics per frame, generating an accompanying temporal profile useful for environmental inspection and remote-sensing analysis.

A modular architecture separates the application into clean units: a Streamlit UI for configuration, a Folium map component for spatial input, a STAC query engine, a data-loading and harmonization module, and a dedicated video-generation subsystem. This design ensures smooth integration, low coupling, and high maintainability. The final result is an exported MP4 time-lapse video that illustrates landscape changes, vegetation dynamics, cloud-free mosaics, or seasonal patterns across the selected region—making the tool accessible for environmental monitoring, agricultural studies, research workflows, and educational exploration.
